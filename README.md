Service Gateway Server
======================

**NOTE!** WORK IN PROGRESS - NOTHING WORKS!!

The Service Gateway concept can be seen as a service exposure/discovery mechanism
that allow hosts expose private service end-points (network ports) at a protected gateway.

The service gateway server is the center where all the connected client-services
are registered and their ports exposed.

The [service gateway client](https://github.com/ZenDevelopmentEcosystem/service-gateway-client)
runs on the service host that is to expose its service(s) at the gateway.
